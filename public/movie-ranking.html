<h1>Three Movies</h1>
<h2>That Popped Into My Mind Yesterday</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ra-One</h3>
<p>This movie was my absolute favourite in my childhood 
    and it's extreme nostalgic to me. I would love to rewatch
it after my exams!</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>If I had to really think of three movies I think Harry Potter
    naturally pop into my mind. I love all the harry potter movies
    They're great!</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>These movies hit the sweet spot! My teachers in school
    played these movies for movie days and we all LOVED them!
